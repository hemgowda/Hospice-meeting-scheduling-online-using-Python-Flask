# Hospice-meeting-scheduling-online-using-Python-Flask
Hospice is a comprehensive, holistic program of care and support for terminally ill patients and their families. Hospice care changes the focus to comfort care (palliative care) for pain relief and symptom management instead of care to cure the patientâ€™s illness.Hospice meeting scheduling online is a project where regularly scheduled meetings, often led by the hospice nurse or social worker, keep family members informed about the patient condition and what to expect. Family members can get great support and stress relief through these meetings.This project is implemented using Python Flask Microweb Framework.

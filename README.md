# Hospice-meeting-scheduling-online-using-Python-Flask
Hospice is a comprehensive, holistic program of care and support for terminally ill patients and their families. Hospice care changes the focus to comfort care (palliative care) for pain relief and symptom management instead of care to cure the patientâ€™s illness.Hospice meeting scheduling online is a project where regularly scheduled meetings, often led by the hospice nurse or social worker, keep family members informed about the patient condition and what to expect. Family members can get great support and stress relief through these meetings.This project is implemented using Python Flask Microweb Framework.


The internship gave an opportunity to explore the following technologies like visual studio
code, Django framework ,Flask microweb and Mongodb. The Flask microweb framework
provides libraries to build lightweight web applications in python. This gives us a simple
and reliable way to create the project. By using flask microweb extensions, we have
successfully accomplished the requirements of the system. Once the user logged in to
the system, user can register through online and an rest API used to add the data. Further
this can be implemented using other framework like Django. I believe that this project is
useful, light weight due to the use of Flask microweb framework and helping in accessing
the data for further analysis.
